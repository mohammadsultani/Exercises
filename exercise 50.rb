# Based on your code for Exercise 10, create a Day Organiser

# First, ask for a time as a single input string in military time (e.g. “16:30”) or standard time (e.g. 04:30PM)
# Then, ask for the activity that will be happening during that time as a string
# Ask the user if that is the last activity they would like to input (Y/N)
# If it’s the last activity, then, list out in order of the day, the activity of the day, together with the time in standard time.
# e.g. Your output should be:
# Your activities today are:
# 04:30AM - Wake up, eat breakfast
# 05:30AM - Go to the gym
# 08:00AM - Head for Recode Class
