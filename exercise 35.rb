# Exercise 35
# Write a method, rotate_array! that duplicates what Array.rotate! does
# Your method should accept an Array and an optional Integer
# The method should mutate the array by rotating the elements based on the number of times input (steps)
# If the steps is positive, the array will be rotated to the right, so the last element is now the first. This will be repeated for the steps
# If the steps is negative, the array will be rotated to the left, so the first element is now the last. This will be repeated for the steps
# If the steps is not provided, the array will rotated once to the right (Same as steps = 1)
# The method should return the given array
# You are not allowed to use Array#rotate or Array#rotate!
# 
# Note: this method has a BANG!, thus, it must MUTATE the input array. 
# This means that the object_id of the input array should be identical to the object_id of the returned array. 


# Write Your method code here

def rotate_array!(array,steps)
    if steps >= 0
    i = array.length
    x = i - steps
    array.insert(0,array[steps..i])
    x.times { array.delete_at((steps+1)) }
    p array.flatten!
    else
    array.insert(0,array[steps..-1])
    (steps*-1).times {array.pop}
    p array.flatten!
    end   
end
